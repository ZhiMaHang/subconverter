| Telegram-liked HTTP/Socks 5 links |     ✓      |      ×       | Only as source |

Notice:

1. VLESS share links support TLS/REALITY and common TCP, WebSocket, HTTP, HTTPUpgrade, gRPC and XHTTP transports. A node is skipped when the selected target cannot represent its transport without changing semantics.

2. Shadowrocket users should use `ss`, `ssr` or `v2ray` as target.

3. You can add `&remark=` to Telegram-liked HTTP/Socks 5 links to set a remark for this node. For example:

   - tg://http?server=1.2.3.4&port=233&user=user&pass=pass&remark=Example

   - https://t.me/http?server=1.2.3.4&port=233&user=user&pass=pass&remark=Example

## Quick Usage

> Using default groups and rulesets configuration directly, without changing any settings

### Access Interface

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:25500/sub?target=%TARGET%&url=%URL%&config=%CONFIG%
```

### Description

| Argument | Required | Example | Description |
| -------- | :------: | :------ | ----------- |
| target   | Yes      | clash   | Target subscription type. Acquire from Target Name in [Supported Types](#supported-types). |
| url      | Yes      | https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xxx.com | Subscription URLs or single-node links to convert. Separate multiple sources with newlines, `\|`, or repeated `url` parameters, then apply [URLEncode](https://www.urlencoder.org/). |
| config   | No       | https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xxx.com | External configuration file path. Supports URLs and file paths. Process with [URLEncode](https://www.urlencoder.org/) first. More examples can be found in [this](https://github.com/lzdnico/subconverteriniexample) repository. |

To merge subscriptions and single-node links, put one source on each line before URL encoding. Newlines become `%0A` in the request. Generated configurations use a 24-hour update interval by default (`config_update_interval = 86400`), and each client refresh fetches the airport subscriptions again subject to `cache_subscription`. The existing `|` separator and repeated `url` parameters are also supported.

Example:

```txt
You have 2 subscriptions and you want to merge them and generate a Clash subscription:
1. https://dler.cloud/subscribe/ABCDE?clash=vmess
2. https://rich.cloud/subscribe/ABCDE?clash=vmess

First use '|' to separate 2 subscriptions:
https://dler.cloud/subscribe/ABCDE?clash=vmess|https://rich.cloud/subscribe/ABCDE?clash=vmess

Then process it with URLEncode to get %URL%:
https%3A%2F%2Fdler.cloud%2Fsubscribe%2FABCDE%3Fclash%3Dvmess%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Frich.cloud%2Fsubscribe%2FABCDE%3Fclash%3Dvmess

Then fill %TARGET% and %URL% in Access Interface with actual values:
http://127.0.0.1:25500/sub?target=clash&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdler.cloud%2Fsubscribe%2FABCDE%3Fclash%3Dvmess%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Frich.cloud%2Fsubscribe%2FABCDE%3Fclash%3Dvmess

Finally subscribe this link in Clash and you are done!
```

## Advanced Usage

Please refer to [中文文档](https://github.com/tindy2013/subconverter/blob/master/README-cn.md#%E8%BF%9B%E9%98%B6%E7%94%A8%E6%B3%95).

## Auto Upload

> Upload Gist automatically

Add a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) into [gistconf.ini](./gistconf.ini) in the root directory, then add `&upload=true` to the local subscription link, then when you access this link, the program will automatically update the content to Gist repository.

Example:

```ini
[common]
;uncomment the following line and enter your token to enable upload function
token = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx(Your Personal Access Token)
```
